### Final notes — what I did for you
- All pages updated to a consistent purple theme and responsive layout.
- Contact form supports `data-endpoint` attribute (Formspree) — add your endpoint and it will post.
- Lightbox, mobile nav, smooth scroll provided in `app.js`.
- All links and relative paths configured for a standard repo structure.
- README contains GitHub Pages steps.

### Next immediate actions you can pick (reply with number)
1. I will **inject your Formspree endpoint** into contact forms (paste endpoint).  
2. I will **pack everything into a ZIP** file content here for download.  
3. I will **embed your images** (you upload images here) into files as Base64 single-file version.  
4. I will **add Google Apps Script integration** (paste your Apps Script URL).  
5. I will **create additional service subpages automatically** (paste list of service names).  
6. I will **generate a `CNAME` file** and DNS instructions for `zeroassociates.com` (paste domain).

Pick one option (e.g., `1` or `2`) and I’ll act immediately.
